Certainly! Automating the process of liking all posts on your Facebook timeline, including those by people you're not friends with, can be achieved using a browser extension. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install a Browser Extension**:
    - Install a browser extension that allows you to automatically like posts on Facebook. One such extension is "Social Media Toolkit for Facebook" (available for Chrome).
    - Search for the extension in your browser's extension store and install it.

2. **Log in to Facebook**:
    - Open Facebook in your browser and log in to your account.

3. **Navigate to Your Timeline**:
    - Go to your Facebook profile by clicking on your profile picture or your name.

4. **Activate the Extension**:
    - Click on the extension icon in your browser (usually located near the address bar).
    - Look for an option related to automatically liking posts.
    - Click on it to activate the feature.

5. **Confirm the Action**:
    - The extension will likely ask for confirmation before proceeding.
    - Confirm that you want to like all posts on your timeline.

6. **Wait for Completion**:
    - The extension will automatically scroll through your timeline and like each post.
    - Depending on the number of posts, this process may take some time.

Remember that automating interactions on Facebook should comply with their terms of service, and excessive automation may violate those terms. Use this script responsibly and considerate of other users. ðŸ˜Š
